# Loader-for-a-game
This is a project to make a simple but cool loader to come before a game.


If You want to Know how to do that, just go to the "index.html" file.There, copy the code, paste it to any text editor/IDE.

There go to the ***script*** part:

<br>
Then edit the **window.location.href = "SpaceInvader.htm** to whatever file you want by replacing the "SpaceInvaders.htm".


If you want to copy and paste all the HTML for the Space Invader game, including javascript in the same file, [click here.](https://github.com/MKM12345/games/blob/main/CollectionOfgames/SpaceInvaders.htm)

[View the loading Text in the Index.html](https://github.com/MKM12345/Loader-for-a-game/blob/main/index.html)

[View _live_ input here.](https://mkm12345.github.io/) In this instance, I have made the loader come before a Space Invaders game, but you can swap it with anything(see above).
