# Loader-for-a-game
This is a project to make a simple but cool loader to come before a game.



If you want to copy and paste all the HTML for the Space Invader game, including javascript in the same file, [click here.](https://github.com/MKM12345/games/blob/main/CollectionOfgames/SpaceInvaders.htm)

[View _live_ input here.](https://mkm12345.github.io/) In this instance, I have made the loader come before a Space Invaders game, but you can swap it with anything.
